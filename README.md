# Title: Feel the data
1-line description: A machine learning-powered platform to make users feel the
evolution of data through time and hear the impact of such data through emotion
Description: A machine learning-based data sonification and visualization web app to
map data to music and image, generating a ’data experience. The project is meant for
anyone that is able to interact with a web app, from very young people (as it is almost
usable just by looking at the images) to older ones
Our goals are:
to educate the highest number of people possible: to inform the young generations
and to get detached people interested in today’s issues
make an extendible platform
to make data understandable without having to know specific concepts
Challenges, accomplishments, and lessons learned:
# What kind of challenges did you run into for this project?
One of the main challenges we run into has been not being able to work physically
together and divide the work in such a way that it could be easily merged.
Another issue was automatic music composition. At first, we wanted to use a model
(Riffusion) that created complete musical loops using spectrogram images to generate
sound. But after some time we understood that it was too much work for the time we
got. So we decided to go with Magenta which has libraries and models easy to use and
understand.
Lastly, we run into some issues using a framework that allowed us to have a big particle
system that could run in a browser without having performance issues. We solved the
problem by choosing a vanilla javascript algorithm.
